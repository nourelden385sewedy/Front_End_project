            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed
             to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
              It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
               languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

               HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
                other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides
                a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as 
                headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.

                HTML elements are delineated by
                tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "< img >" and < input > directly introduce content
                into the page. Other tags such as < p > and < /p > surround and provide information about document
                text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
                interpret the content of the page.
